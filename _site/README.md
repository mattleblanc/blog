## mattleblanc.github.io/blog/

This is the repository for a [blog](mattleblanc.github.io/blog/) I'm building, in order to learn more about [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

## References

This site uses Hyde, which is a theme built on top of [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole). Poole is the 'butler' of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), which is a 'blog-aware static website generator.'

For questions about Hyde and Poole, you'll probably want to talk to: **Mark Otto**
