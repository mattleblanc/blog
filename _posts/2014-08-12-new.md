This is a test of a few different systems that I've wanted to play with lately: namely, [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), which I guess I'm testing via [Poole](http://demo.getpoole.com/). In particular, I'm playing with the Poole's [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) theme.

I plan to use this space to publish little odds and ends that I need a place for. If you like what you see here in the future, feel free to [tell me so](http://www.twitter.com/NA_48).

Cheers!
